# Attendance-System
The traditional technique of marking the attendance of students on the paper, is a time-consuming and tedious process. Thus, the newer technique of the Smart Attendance System helps in reducing the teacher's work and makes in easier. 
In this project, the Open CV based face recognition approach has been proposed. The model integrates a camera that captures an input image, an algorithm for detecting face from an input image, encoding and identifying the face, marking the attendance in a spreadsheet and converting it into PDF file.
